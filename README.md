# assignment_vendingmachine
This is the excerise that comes along with the Gain workshop Introduction OOA & OOD.
In this workshop our engineers within the PLC-domain are introduced to the wording of Object to Encapsulation,
requirements engineering, Decomposition, Scenario's, Sequential diagrams and Object Models and UML.

The goal of this excercise is to prepare them for a course OOA & OOD, preferrably within the PLC-domain. And preferrably this PLC-domain is Codesys based.

The excersie is to model the software for a basic Vendingmachine. The code in this repository is one way of how this could be achieved.
